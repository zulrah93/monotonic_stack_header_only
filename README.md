# Monotonic Stack Implementation in C++
A monotonic stack implementation (both for increasing and decreasing) in a header file to include. Very simple implentation.
## Explanation
A monotonic sequence is one where the elements are increasing or staying constant or decreasing and staying constant but once it's increasing or decreasing it must stay like that. For example [1, 2, 2, 3] is a monotonic increasing where as [3, 2, 2, 1] is decreasing. [1, 2, 1, 3] is not monotonic. A monotonic stack is a stack that is ordered like a monotonic sequence. Certain algorithm problems require it but it isn't a common data structure.
